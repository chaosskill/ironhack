    "<b>Explore</b>: answer questions like: group donors (by gender, by state), what’s the distribution by group, are there noticeable group differences? \n",
    "<b>Process</b>: Look at what model to apply (might need to change how some columns are expressed) \n",
    "<b>Training</b>: create model to predict donation amount of each doner \n",
    "<b>Validate</b>: check predictions against a little subset of the data \n",
